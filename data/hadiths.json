A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: 'Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.' Thereupon, one of them said: 'O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock'. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape. The next said: 'O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.' The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out. The third one said: 'O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours - camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.'

Now since you are one of the Companions of the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), I have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") concerning it?\". He replied in the affirmative and said, \"He (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). In other cases such as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands over light boots will suffice.\" I, then, questioned him, \"Did you hear him say anything about love and affection?\" He replied, \"We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") in a journey when a bedouin called out in a loud voice, 'O Muhammad.' The Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") replied him in the same tone, 'Here I am.' I said to him (the bedouin), 'Woe to you, lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.' He said, 'By Allah!

Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") replied, 'On the Day of Resurrection, a person will be in the company of those whom he loves.' The Messenger of Allah then kept on talking to us and in the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years\".Sufyan, one of the narrators of this tradition, said: \"This gateway is in the direction of Syria.

He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred. He then asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the affirmative and asked, 'Who stands between you and repentance? Go to such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place.' So he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The angels of mercy pleaded, 'This man has come with a repenting heart to Allah,' and the angels of punishment argued, 'He never did a virtuous deed in his life.' Then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them. He said, 'Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.' They measured and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul\".[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].In another version: \"He was found to be nearer to the locality of the pious by a cubit and was thus included among them\". Another version says: \"Allah commanded (the land which he wanted to leave) to move away and commanded the other land (his destination) to draw nearer and then He said: \"Now measure the distance between them.' It was found that he was nearer to his goal by a hand's span and was thus forgiven\". It is also narrated that he drew closer by a slight movement on his chest.",

      "En_Text": " \"I accompanied Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle of Tabuk and the battle of Badr. As for the battle of Badr, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and the Muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of the Quraish. Allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. I had the honour of being with Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") on the night of 'Aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was dearer to me than participating in the battle of Badr, although Badr was more well-known among the people than that. And this is the account of my staying behind from the battle of Tabuk. I never had better means and more favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. And by Allah, I had never before possessed two riding-camels as I did during the time of this expedition. Whenever Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") decided to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the last moment (of departure). But on this expedition, he set out in extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual position so that they should make full preparation for the campaign. And the Muslims who accompanied Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") at that time were in large number but no proper record of them was maintained.\" Ka'b (further) said: \"Few were the persons who chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves (and thus remain undetected) unless Revelation from Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious (revealed relating to them). And Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was sought. I had a weakness for them and it was during this season that Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and the Muslims made preparations. I also would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but would come back having done nothing and said to myself: 'I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like'. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") set out along with the Muslims, but I had made no preparations. I would go early in the morning and come back, but with no decision. I went on doing so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. Then I wished to march on and join them. Would that I had done that! But perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") whenever I went out, I was grieved to find no good example to follow but confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom Allah had exempted (from marching forth for Jihad). Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") made no mention of me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting with the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What happened to Ka'b bin Malik?' A person from Banu Salimah said: \"O Messenger of Allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an appreciation of his finery have detained him.' Upon this Mu'adh bin Jabal (MatAllah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"): \"By Allah, we know nothing about him but good.' Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), however, kept quiet. At that time he (the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")) saw a person dressed in white and said, 'Be Abu Khaithamah.' And was Abu Khaithamah Al- Ansari was the person who had contributed a Sa' of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.\" Ka'b bin Malik further said: \"When the news reached me that Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") was on his way back from Tabuk, I was greatly distressed. I thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger the next day. In this connection, I sought the counsels of every prudent member of my family. When I was told that Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas vanished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing but the truth could save me. So I decided to tell him the truth. It was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") arrived in Al-Madinah. It was his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go to the mosque and perform two Rak'ah (of optional prayer) and would then sit with the people. When he sat, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. They were more than eighty in number. Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to Allah, until I appeared before him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He then said to me, 'Come forward'. I went forward and I sat in front of him. He said to me, 'What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride?' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and I have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware that if I were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you, Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. In case, I speak the truth, you may be angry with me, but I hope that Allah would be pleased with me (and accept my repentance). By Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind.' Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, 'This man spoke the truth, so get up (and wait) until Allah gives a decision about you.' I left and some people of Banu Salimah followed me. They said to me, 'By Allah, we do not know that you committed a sin before. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") like those who stayed behind him. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") would have sought forgiveness for you.' By Allah, they kept on reproaching me until I thought of going back to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and retract my confession. Then I said to them, 'Has anyone else met the same fate?' They said, 'Yes, two persons have met the same fate. They made the same statement as you did and the same verdict was delivered in their case.' I asked, 'Who are they?' They said, 'Murarah bin Ar-Rabi' Al-'Amri and Hilal bin Umaiyyah Al- Waqifi.' They mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I was confirmed in my original resolve. Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") prohibited the Muslims to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in fact the same atmosphere of which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent (most of their) time weeping. As I was the youngest and the strongest, I would leave my house, attend the congregational Salat, move about in the bazaars, but none would speak to me. I would come to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") as he sat amongst (people) after the Salat, greet him and would ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings. Then I would perform Salat near him and look at him stealthily. When I finish my Salat, he would look at me and when I would cast a glance at him he would turn away his eyes from me. When the harsh treatment of the Muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, I walked and I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin, and I had a great love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not answer to my greeting. I said to him, 'O Abu Qatadah, I adjure you in the Name of Allah, are you not aware that I love Allah and His Messenger (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")?' I asked him the same question again but he remained silent. I again adjured him, whereupon he said, 'Allah and His Messenger (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") know better.' My eyes were filled with tears, and I came back climbing down the wall.As I was walking in the bazaars of Al-Madinah, a man from the Syrian peasants, who had come to sell food grains in Al-Madinah, asked people to direct him to Ka'b bin Malik. People pointed towards me. He came to me and delivered a letter from the King of Ghassan, and as I was a scribe, I read that letter whose purport was: 'It has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")) was treating you harshly. Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place; so come to us and we shall receive you graciously.' As I read that letter I said: 'This is too a trial,' so I put it to fire in an oven. When forty days had elapsed and Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") received no Revelation, there came to me a messenger of the Messenger of Allah and said, 'Verily, Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") has commanded you to keep away from your wife.' I said, 'Should I divorce her or what else should I do?' He said, 'No, but only keep away from her and don't have sexual contact with her.' The same message was sent to my companions. So, I said to my wife: 'You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case.' The wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah came to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umaiyyah is a senile person and has no servant. Do you disapprove if I serve him?' He said, 'No, but don't let him have any sexual contact with you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no such desire left in him. By Allah, he has been in tears since (this calamity) struck him.' Members of my family said to me, 'You should have sought permission from Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") in regard to your wife. He has allowed the wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah to serve him.' I said, 'I would not seek permission from Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") for I do not know what Messenger of Allah might say in response to that, as I am a young man'. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty days had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to us. After I had offered my Fajr prayer on the early morning of the fiftieth day of this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had sat in the very state which Allah described as: 'The earth seemed constrained for me despite its vastness', I heard the voice of a proclaimer from the peak of the hill Sal' shouting at the top of his voice: 'O Ka'b bin Malik, rejoice.' I fell down in prostration and came to know that there was (a message of) relief for me. Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") had informed the people about the acceptance of our repentance by Allah after he had offered the Fajr prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my companions in order to give them the glad tidings. A man spurred his horse towards me (to give the good news), and another one from the tribe of Aslam came running for the same purpose and, as he approached the mount, I received the good news which reached me before the rider did. When the one whose voice I had heard came to me to congratulate me, I took off my garments and gave them to him for the good news he brought to me. By Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) except these garments, at that time. Then I borrowed two garments, dressed myself and came to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") On my way, I met groups of people who greeted me for (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: 'Congratulations for acceptance of your repentance.' I reached the mosque where Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") was sitting amidst people. Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me, shook hands with me and greeted me. By Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the Muhajirun besides him.\" Ka'b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talhah. Ka'b further said: \"I greeted Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") with 'As-salamu 'alaikum' and his face was beaming with pleasure. He (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, 'Rejoice with the best day you have ever seen since your mother gave you birth. 'I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Is this (good news) from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' And it was common with Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") that when ever he was happy, his face would glow as if it were a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognized it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said, I have placed a condition upon myself that if Allah accepts my Taubah, I would give up all of my property in charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")!' Thereupon Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, 'Keep some property with you, as it is better for you.' I said, 'I shall keep with me that portion which is in Khaibar'. I added: 'O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and therefore, repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long as I am alive.\" Ka'b added: \"By Allah, I do not know anyone among the Muslims who has been granted truthfulness better than me since I said this to the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"). By Allah! Since the time I made a pledge of this to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), I have never intended to tell a lie, and I hope that Allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the rest of my life. Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious, revealed these Verses:'Allah has forgiven the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), the Muhajirun (Muslim Emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar (Muslims of Al- Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")) in the time of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three who did not join [the Tabuk expedition and whose case was deferred (by the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")) for Allah's Decision] till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His Pardon [repent (unto Him)]. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in word and deeds).\" (9:117,118).Ka'b said: \"By Allah, since Allah guided me to Islam, there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who had told lies, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else, as He sent down the Revelation:They will swear by Allah to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijsun [i.e., Najasun (impure) because of their evil deeds], and Hell is their dwelling place - a recompense for that which they used to earn. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are Al- Fa'siqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)\". (9:95,96)Ka'b further added: \"The matter of the three of us remained pending for decision apart from the case of those who had made excuses on oath before Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and he accepted those, took fresh oaths of allegiance from them and supplicated for their forgiveness. The Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") kept our matter pending till Allah decided it. The three whose matter was deferred have been shown mercy. The reference here is not to our staying back from the expedition but to his delaying our matter and keeping it pending beyond the matter of those who made their excuses on oath which he accepted\".[Al- Bukhari and Muslim]Another version adds: \"Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") set out for Tabuk on Thursday. He used to prefer to set out on journey on Thursday.\" Another version says: \"Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") used to come back from a journey in the early forenoon and went straight to the mosque where he would perform two Rak'ah prayer. Afterwards he would seat himself there\".",

      "En_Text": "The Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, \"There lived a king before you and he had a court magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king:'I have grown old, so send me a young boy in order to teach him magic.' The king sent him a young boy to serve the purpose. And on his way (to the magician) the young boy met a monk to whom he listened to and liked it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician, he would meet the monk and sit there and would come to the magician (late). The magician used to beat him because of this delay. He complained about this to the monk who said to him: 'When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family detained me. And when you fear your family, say: The magician detained me.' It so happened that there came a huge beast and it blocked the way of the people, and the young boy said: 'I will know today whether the magician or the monk is better.' He picked up a stone and said: 'O Allah, if the way of the monk is dearer to You than the way of the magician, bring about death to the animal so that the people be able to move about freely.' He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people began to move about freely. He then came to the monk and told him the story. The monk said: 'Son, today you are superior to me. You have come to a stage where I feel that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not reveal me.' That young boy began to heal those born blind and the lepers and he, in fact, began to cure people from all kinds of illnesses. When a courtier of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said, 'If you cure me, all these things will be yours.' He said, 'I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah, the Exalted, Alone Who cures; and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate to Allah to cure you.' This courtier affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him, 'Who restored your eyesight?' He said, 'My Rubb.' Thereupon he said, 'Do you have another lord besides me?' He said, 'My Rubb and your Rubb is Allah.' So the king kept torturing him untill he revealed the young boy. The young boy was thus summoned and the king said to him, 'O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and the lepers and you do such and such.' Thereupon he said, 'I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Alone Who cures,' and the king took hold of him and began to torture him until he revealed of the monk. The monk was summoned and it was said to him: 'You should turn back from your religion.' But he refused. The king sent for a saw, placed it in the middle of his head and cut him into two parts that fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought forward and it was said to him: 'Turn back from your religion.' He, too, refused, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and he was torn into two parts. Then the boy was sent for and it was said to him: 'Turn back from your religion.' He refused. The king then handed him over to a group of his courtiers, and said to them: 'Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its peak ask him to renounce his Faith. If he refuses to do so, push him to his death.' So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: 'O Allah, save me from them in any way you like,' and the mountain began to shake and they all fell down (dead) and that young boy came walking to the king. The king said to him, 'What happened to your companions?' He said, 'Allah has saved me from them.' He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: 'Take him and carry him in a boat and when you reach the middle of the sea, ask him to renounce his religion. If he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).' So they took him and he said: 'O Allah, save me from them.' The boat turned upside down and they all drowned except the young boy who came walking to the king. The king said to him, 'What happened to your companions?' He said, 'Allah has saved me from them,' and he said to the king: 'You cannot kill me until you do what I command you to do.' The king asked, 'What is that?' He said, 'Gather all people in one place and tie me up to the trunk of a tree, then take an arrow from my quiver and say: With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the boy; then shoot me. If you do that you will be able to kill me.' 'The king called the people in an open field and tied the young boy to the trunk of a tree. He took out an arrow from his quiver, fixed in the bow and said, 'With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the young boy,' he then shot the arrow and it hit the boy's temple. The young boy placed his hand upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and died. The people then said: 'We believe in the Rubb of this young boy.' The king was told: 'Do you see what you were afraid of, by Allah it has taken place; all people have believed.' The king then commanded that trenches be dug and fire lit in them, and said: 'He who would not turn back from his (the young boy's) religion, throw him in the fire' or 'he would be ordered to jump into it.' They did so till a woman came with her child. She felt hesitant in jumping into the fire. The child said to her: 'O mother! Endure (this ordeal) for you are on the Right Path\".[Muslim].",

Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, \"Better than before\". Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: \"Arrange for the burial of the boy\". In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and informed him of the event. He enquired, \"Did you sleep together last night?\" Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") supplicated, \"O Allah bless them.\" Thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: \"Take up the boy and carry him to the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")\"; and he sent some dates with him. The Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") enquired, \"Is there anything with him?\" He said; \"Yes, some dates\". The Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") took a date, chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date around the baby's gum and named him 'Abdullah.[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn 'Uyainah relates that a man from the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this 'Abdullah, every one of whom had committed the Noble Qur'an to memory.The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of the family: \"Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son until I mention it to him myself.\" Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said, \"O Abu Talhah! If some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.\" He said, \"No\". She said, \"Then hope reward for your son\". Abu Talhah got angry, and said; \"You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. \"He went to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and informed him about the matter. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, \"May Allah bless the night you spent together!\" He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. When Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") used to come back to Al-Madinah from a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people came near Al- Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained with her and Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: \"O Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.\" Umm Sulaim then said: \"O Abu Talhah, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to me: \"O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") tomorrow morning.\" The next morning I carried the baby with me to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), and narrated the rest of the story.[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].",

He therefore, sent to them an angel who came to the leper and asked him what he would like best. He replied: \"A good colour, a good skin and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people\". He (the angel) rubbed him and his loathsomeness vanished and he was given a good colour and a good skin. He then asked him what type of property he would like best. The leper replied that he would like camels - [or perhaps he said cattle, for Ishaq (one of the subnarrator of the Hadith) was uncertain, either said: 'Camels,' or: 'Cattle']. He was given a pregnant she-camel. The angel invoked for Allah's Blessing on it. The angel then went to the bald man and asked him what he would like best and he replied: \"Good hair and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people\". The angel ran his hand over him and he was given good hair. He then asked him what property he would like best. He replied that he would like cattle, so he was given a pregnant cow. The angel invoked Allah's Blessing on it. The angel then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best, and he replied: \"I wish that Allah restore my sight to me so that I may see people.\" Thereupon the angel ran his hand over him and Allah restored his sight. The angel then asked what property he would like best. He replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant ewe. Flocks and herds were produced for the three men, the first having a valley full of camels, the second one, a valley full of cows and the third one full of sheep. Then the angel came in the form of a leper, to the one who had been a leper, and said: \"I am a poor man and my resources have been exhausted in my journey, and my only means of reaching my destination are dependent on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property, for a camel by which I may get to my destination\". He replied: \"I have many dues to pay.\" The angel then said: \"I think I recognize you. Were you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom Allah gave property?\" He replied: \"I inherited this property through generations\". The angel said: \"If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition\". The angel went in the form of a bald man to the one who had been bald, and said the same as he had said to the former and received a similar reply. So he said: \"If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition\". The angel then went to the one who had been blind and said: \"I am a poor traveller and my resources have been exhausted in my journey. My only means of reaching my destination are dependant on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who restored your eyesight for a sheep by which I may get to the end of my journey\". He replied: \"Yes, I was blind. Allah restored my eyesight, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by Allah that I shall not argue with you today to return anything you take, as I give it for Allah's sake\". The angel said: \"Keep your property.

Have I not been informed that you observe fast during the day and offer prayer all the night.\" I replied, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah!\" Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, \"Don't do that. Observe fast for few days and then leave off for few days, perform prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right upon you, and your eyes have a right upon you; and your wife has a right upon you; your visitors have a right upon you. It is sufficient for you to observe fast three days in a month, as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting the whole year.\" I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction.

It is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good,\" whereupon he (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, \"Then observe fasts like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") as he was the most ardent worshipper of Allah; recite the Qur'an once every month.\" I said, \"O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of doing more than that.\" He said, \"Then recite it (the complete Qur'an) in every twenty days.\" I said, \"O Prophet of Allah I am capable of reciting more than that.\" He said, \"Then recite it once in every ten days.\" I said, \"O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of reciting more than that.\" He said, \"Then recite it once in every seven days, but not recite more than that.\" The Prophet of Allah also said to me, \"You do not know, you may have a longer life\". When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted to me by) the Prophet of Allah.In another narration 'Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, \"The best fasting with Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud, and the best prayer with Allah is that of Dawud (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") for he would sleep half of the night and stand for prayer for the third of it and (then) would sleep sixth part of it; he observed fast one day and leave off the other. He would not flee on meeting the enemy\".In another narration 'Abdullah is reported to have said: My father helped me marry a noble woman and he used to inquire of his daughter-in-law regarding her husband. She would say: \"He is, indeed, a fine man. Since I have come to him, he has neither stepped on my bed nor he has had sexual intercourse with me\". When this state of affairs lasted for some time, my father mentioned the matter to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") who directed my father saying, \"Send him to me\". I went to him accordingly. He asked me, \"How often do you observe fast?\" I replied; \"Daily\". He asked me, \"How long do you take in reading the Noble Qur'an completely.\" I said, \"Once every night\". Then he narrated the whole story. He (in his old age) would recite one seventh of his nightly recitation to some members of his family during the day to lighten his task at night. Whenever he wished to have a relief from his fast on alternate days, he would give up fasting for a few days and make up deficiency later by observing the number of fasts he had missed. He would not give up the number of fasts altogether because he did not like to abandon what he had settled with Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\").</div>",

Most of them rather, all of them, belonged to the Mudar tribe. The face of the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") changed when he saw them starving.

Be dutiful to your Rubb, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both He created many men and women; and fear Allah through Whom you demand your (natural) rights, and do not sever the relations of kinship. Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you.\" (4:1) He also recited the Ayah which is in the end of Surat Al-Hashr: \"O you who believe! Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every one look what he has sent forth for the tomorrow\". (59:18). Thereafter, every man gave in charity Dinar, Dirham, clothes, measure-fulls of wheat and measure-fulls of dates till he said: \"(Give in charity) be it half a date\". Then a man of the Ansar came with a bag which was difficult for him to hold in his hand. Thereafter, the people came successively (with charity) till I saw two heaps of food and clothes. I noticed that the face of Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") was glowing like that of the bright moon or glittering gold. Then he (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") said, \"Whosoever introduces a good practice in Islam, there is for him its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him without anything being diminished from their rewards. And whosoever introduces an evil practice in Islam, will shoulder its sin and the sins of all those who will act upon it, without diminishing in any way their burden\"[Muslim].",

That was because they disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds.

You see many of them taking the disbelievers as their Auliya' (protectors and helpers).

I expect that I shall be the the wronged one today. I am much worried about my debt. Do you think that anything will be left over from our property after the payment of my debt? My son, sell our property and pay off my debt.\" Az-Zubair then willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely 'Abdullah's sons. He said, \"One-third of the one-third. If any property is left after the payment of debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left is to be given to your sons.\" (Hisham, a subnarrator added: \"Some of the sons of 'Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair, e.g., Khubaib and Abbad. 'Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time)\". (The narrator 'Abdullah added:) He kept on instructing me about his debts and then said: \"My son, should you find yourself unable to pay any portion of my debt then beseech my Master for His help.\" By Allah, I did not understand what he meant and asked: \"Father, who is your Master?\" He said: \"Allah.\" By Allah! Whenever I faced a difficulty in discharging any portion of his debt; I would pray: \"O Master of Zubair, discharge his debt,\" and He discharged it. Zubair was martyred. He left no money, but he left certain lands, one of them in Al-Ghabah, eleven houses in Al-Madinah, two in Basrah, one in Kufah and one in Egypt. The cause of his indebtedness was that a person would come to him asking him to keep some money of his in trust for him. Zubair would refuse to accept it as a trust, fearing it might be lost, but would take it as a loan. He never accepted a governorship, or revenue office, or any public office. He fought along with Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman (May Allah be pleased with them).'Abdullah added: I prepared a statement of his debts and they amounted to two million and two hundred thousand! Hakim bin Hizam met me and asked me: \"Nephew, how much is due from my brother as debt?\" I kept it as secret and said: \"A hundred thousand.\" Hakim said: \"By Allah! I do not think your assets are sufficient for the payment of these debts.\" I said: \"What would you think if the amount were two million and two hundred thousand?\" He said: \"I do not think that you would be able to clear off the debts. If you find it difficult let me know.\"Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) had purchased the land in Al-Ghabah for a hundred and seventy thousand. 'Abdullah sold it for a million and six hundred thousand, and declared that whosoever had a claim against Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) should see him in Al-Ghabah. 'Abdullah bin Ja'far (May Allah bepleased with him) came to him and said: \"Az- Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) owed me four hundred thousand, but I would remit the debt if you wish.\" 'Abdullah (May Allah bepleased with him) said: \"No.\" Ibn Ja'far said: ''If you would desire for postponement I would postpone the recovery of it.\" 'Abdullah said: \"No.\" Ibn Ja'far then said: \"In that case, measure out a plot for me.\" 'Abdullah marked out a plot. Thus he sold the land and discharged his father's debt. There remained out of the land four and a half shares. He then visited Mu'awiyah who had with him at the time 'Amr bin 'Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam'ah (May Allah bepleased with them). Mu'awiyah (May Allah bepleased with him) said: \"What price did you put on the land in Al-Ghabah?\" He said: \"One hundred thousand for a each share. Mu'awiyah inquired: \"How much of it is left?\" 'Abdullah said: \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said: \"I will buy one share for a hundred thousand\". 'Amr bin 'Uthman said: \"I will buy one share for a hundred thousand\". Ibn Zam'ah said: \"I will buy one share for a hundred thousand.\" Then Mu'awiyah asked: \"How much of it is now left?\" 'Abdullah said: \"One and a half share. Mu'awiyah said: \"I will take it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" Later 'Abdullah bin Ja'far sold his share to Mu'awiyah for six hundred thousand.When 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) finished the debts, the heirs of Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) asked him to distribute the inheritance among them. He said: \"I will not do that until I announce during four successive Hajj seasons: 'Let he who has a claim against Az-Zubair come forward and we shall discharge it.\"' He made this declaration on four Hajj seasons and then distributed the inheritance among the heirs of Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) according to his will. Az- Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) had four wives. Each of them received a million and two hundred thousand. Thus Az-Zubair's total property was amounted to fifty million and two hundred thousand.[Al-Bukhari]",

Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") went with some of his Companions to bring about peace between them and he was detained. The time for Salat approached and Bilal (May Allah be pleased with them) went to Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) and said to him: \"Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") has got late and it is the time for Salat.

Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) stepped forward and commenced As- Salat. (He recited Takbir and the people followed him). In the meantime, Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") arrived and, passing through the rows, took his stand in the first row. The people started clapping. It was the habit of Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) that whenever he started praying, he would never look round. He paid no heed (to the clapping). When the clapping increased, he turned round and saw Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"). He (the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")) beckoned him to continue performing Salat. But Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) raised his hands and praised Allah.

When he finished Salat, he faced the congregation and said, \"Why do you clap when something happens during the Salat. Clapping is only for women. If something happens in the course of Salat you should say, Subhan Allah. It is bound to attract attention. And you, Abu Bakr, what prevented you from carrying on with Salat, after I beckoned to do so?\" He said, \"It was not becoming for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead Salat in the presence of Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")\".[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].",

Juraij took a secluded monastery for worship and confined himself in it. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she called: 'Juraij.' He said: 'My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer.' He continued with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was (still) busy in prayer. She called: 'Juraij.' And he said: 'My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer,' and she returned. Then on the next day she again came while he was busy in prayer and called: 'Juraij.' And he said: 'My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in my prayer.' And he continued with the prayer. She said: 'My Rubb, don't let him die until he has seen the faces of the prostitutes.' The story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer spread amongst Banu Israel. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty personified. She said (to the people): 'If you like, I can lure him to evil.' She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him. He (the shepherd) had sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant. When she gave birth to a baby she said: 'This is from Juraij.' So they came and asked Juraij to get down and demolished the temple and began to beat him. He asked them what the matter was. They said: 'You have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a baby from you.' He said: 'Where is the baby?' They brought him (the baby) and then he said: 'Just leave me so that I should perform prayer.' He performed prayer and when he finished, he lifted the baby in his stomach and asked him: 'O boy, who is your father?' The baby answered: 'He is such and such a shepherd.' So, the people turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking blessing) and said: 'We are prepared to construct your temple with gold.' He said, 'No just, rebuild it with mud as it had been,' and so they did\". (The Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") continued:) \"Then there was a baby who was sucking at his mother's breast when a person dressed in fine garment came on a priceless riding animal's back. His mother said: 'O Allah, make my child like this one.' He (the babe) left sucking and looked at him, and said: 'O Allah, don't make me like him.' He then returned to the breast and resumed sucking.\" He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: As though I can see Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") as he is illustrating the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)) further reported Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") as saying, \"There happened to pass by them a slave girl who was being beaten and they were saying: 'You have committed fornication and theft.' She was saying: 'Allah is enough for me and He is my Good Protector, and his mother said: 'O Allah, don't make my child like her.' He left sucking looked at her and said: 'O Allah! Make me like her.' It was followed by a conversation between the mother and the child. She said: 'A good looking man happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and there passed a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and theft, and I said: O Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her.' The child said: 'That man was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah don't make me like him; and they were saying about the girl: You committed fornication, whereas in fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft, whereas she had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her\".[Al- Bukhari and Muslim].",

He said, \"Let him in and give him glad tidings of entering Jannah together with a tribulation which he will have to face.\" I came back to him and said, \"You may enter; and Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") gives you the glad tidings of entering Jannah together with a tribulation that will afflict you.\" He got in and saw that the elevated platform round the well was fully occupied. So he sat on opposite side. Sa'id bin Al- Musaiyab (May Allah be pleased with him) a subnarrator has reported: The order in which they sat down indicated the places of their burial.[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].Another narration adds: Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") ordered me to guard the door. When 'Uthman was told (about the misfortune) he praised Allah then said: \"Allahu Musta'an (His help is to be sought).\"(The interpretation of Sa'id bin Al-Musaiyab is that the graves of Abu Bakr and 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) are by the side of the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), in the same position they took when they sat next to the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") while the grave of 'Uthman is away from their graves, in the public graveyard of Al-Madinah known as Baqi' Al-Gharqad).",

All of a sudden the Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") got up and left us. When he was late to return to us we began to worry lest he should meet with trouble in our absence. I was the first to be alarmed and set out in search of him until I came to a garden belonging to Banu-Najjar (a section of the Ansar). I went round it looking for an entrance, but failed to find one. However, I saw a stream of water flowing into the garden from a well outside. I drew myself together like a fox and slinked into the place and reached the Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"). He said, \"Is it Abu Hurairah?\" I replied in the affirmative. He asked, \"What is the matter with you?\" I replied, \"You were sitting with us and then you left us and delayed for a time. Fearing you had met with some adversities we got alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I squeezed myself like a fox and these people are coming behind me.\" He (the Prophet (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\")) gave me his sandals and said, \"O Abu Hurairah! Take these sandals of mine, and whoever you meet outside this garden testifying that La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah), being assured of it in his heart, give him the glad tidings that he will enter Jannah.\" (Abu Hurairah then narrated the Hadith in full).[Muslim].",

      "En_Text": "We visited 'Amr bin Al-'as (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was in his deathbed. He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: \"O father, did not the Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") give you the good news of such and such? Did he not give you glad tidings of such and such?\" Then he ('Amr) turned his face towards us and said: \"The best thing which you can count upon is the affirmation that: La ilaha illallah (there is no true god except Allah), and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. I have passed through three phases. I remember when I hated none more than I hated the Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), and there was no other desire stronger in me than that of killing him. Had I died in that state, I would have definitely been one of the dwellers of Fire (Hell). When Allah instilled the love for Islam in my heart, I went to Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") and said, 'Extend your right hand, so that I pledge allegiance to you.' He (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") stretched out his right hand, but I withdrew my hand. He said, 'What is the matter, 'Amr?' I said, 'I wish to lay down same conditions.' He asked, 'What conditions do you wish to put forward?' I replied, 'To be granted forgiveness.' He said, 'Do you not know that (embracing) Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). Verily, emigration wipes out all the previous sins, and the Hajj (pilgrimage) wipes out all the previous sins.' Thereafter, no one was dearer to me than Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\"), and none was more respectable than him in my eyes. So bright was his splendour that I could not gather enough courage to look at his face for any length of time. If I were asked to describe his feature, I would not be able to do so because I have never caught a full glimpse of his face. Had I died in that state I could have hoped to be one of the dwellers of Jannah. Thereafter, we were made responsible for many things and in the light of which I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, no mourner, nor fire should accompany my bier. When you bury me, throw the earth gently over me and stand over my grave for the space of time within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy, and in your presence ascertain what answer can I give to the Messengers of my Rubb (the angels in grave).\"[Muslim].",

He was a lonesome person and would rarely spend some time in the company of people. He would spend most of his time in performing Salat and when he finished, he would engage himself in Tasbih (Subhan-Allah) and Takbir (Allahu Akbar), till he would go home. He passed by us one day when we were sitting with Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him).

When they returned, one of them came to the assemblage in which Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") was present and said to his neighbour during the conversation: 'I wish you had seen us when we encountered the enemy. So-and-so (a believer) took up his spear, struck and said: Take this from me and I am the Ghifari boy. Now what do you think of this?' The neighbour said: 'I think that he lost his reward because of boasting.' He said: 'I see no harm in it.' They began to exchange arguments till Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") heard them and said, 'Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from every imperfection). He would be rewarded (in the Hereafter) and praised (in this world)'. I noticed that Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) felt a great pleasure at this remark and, raising his head began to repeat: \"Have you heard Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") say this!\" Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) continued responding till I asked Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) not to annoy him.Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) happened to pass by us another day and Abud-Darda' said to him: \"Tell us something which will benefit us and will not harm you.\" He said: \"The Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") told us, 'He who spends to purchase a horse (for Jihad) is like one who extends his hand for spending out of charity without withholding it.\"'He passed by us another day and Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"Tell us something which might benefit us, and will not harm you.\" He said: \"The Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") once said, 'Khuraim Al-Usaidi is an excellent man were it not of his long hair and his lower garment which is hanging down.' When Khuraim heard about what the Prophet had said about him, he trimmed his long hair up to his ears with a knife and raised his lower garment half way on his shanks.\"On another occasion he passed by us and Abud-Darda' (May Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"Tell us something that will benefit us and will not harm you.\" He said that he heard Messenger of Allah (\"sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam\") say, while coming back from an expedition: \"You are returning to your brothers, so set your saddles and clothes in order so that you look tidy and graceful.
